     <h3>What is ecommerce?</h3>
<p>Ecommerce or "electronic commerce" is the trading of goods and services online. The internet allows individuals and businesses to buy and sell an increasing amount of physical goods, digital goods, and services electronically.</p>

<p>Some businesses sell exclusively online or use ecommerce to expand the reach of their other distribution channels. Either way, ecommerce is thriving and can be a profitable venture. Let’s dive into the details of how ecommerce works and find out if it’s right for you.</p>

<h3>How does ecommerce work? </h3>

<p>Ecommerce works by connecting sellers with customers and allowing exchanges to take place online. It can work in many different ways and take many forms. Here’s a general overview of how the process can look:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The seller chooses online selling channels, like a website or social media, and promotes products or services for sale.</li>
  <li>Customers find the products or services and place orders.</li>
  <li>A payment processor enables the exchange of the goods or services electronically via payment options like credit cards or digital currencies.</li>
  <li>The customer receives a confirmation email or SMS along with a printable receipt.</li>
  <li>If the transaction is for goods, the seller ships the products and sends the customer a tracking number via email or SMS. If the transaction is for a service, the service provider can reach out to schedule and complete the service.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Along the way, many ecommerce tools and technologies work together to help make online purchases possible. On the technical side, the transaction can depend on data, logistics, warehousing, supply chains, and other systems and processes.

<h3>Where and how does ecommerce take place?</h3>

<p>Ecommerce offers people the convenience of shopping from their computers, phones, tablets, and other devices. They visit websites, social media pages, and other virtual channels to find what they’re looking for. Entrepreneurs, startups, small and medium-sized businesses, and large retailers can all use ecommerce to reach customers across the globe. Selling online might be a business’s sole revenue source, or it might be part of a multi-channel selling strategy. For example, a large brick-and-mortar retailer might adopt an online sales channel, or an entrepreneur might sell a small number of specialty handcrafted goods through a social media site like Facebook, Instagram, or Pinterest.</p>

<p>Another ecommerce example is social media commerce. Some websites like Facebook support online purchases. A business that generates revenue solely through its presence on social media, or entrepreneurs who supplement their income using social media marketing techniques, are also engaging in social media commerce.</p>  
    
<p>Other ways you can participate in ecommerce include building standalone websites, or setting up shop on an established selling website. For example, you can create a storefront to represent your brand in the Demo store.</p>
